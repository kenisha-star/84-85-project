We have a rover there and the background is of mars. We can move
the rover on the canvas using keyboard arrow keys.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<body onload="add();">

Once the page is loaded, the body is loaded and this onload event will
occur.
● So inside this onload event we have placed an add function. This means
when the page is loaded the add function will be called automatically.
● We are doing this because when the page is loaded we want the canvas,
rover and the background image to be loaded
